            <h2>traveling</h2>
            <p>As you can probably see, I am from Kansas City, Missouri. I do love living in KC but I also really enjoy seeing other parts of the world. I enjoy all types of trips including camping, beach bumming, hiking, sightseeing, etc.. One of my favorite trips I have taken is from the picture above when my boyfriend and I traveled across Europe. We absolutely fell in love with Italy and are hoping to go back sometime soon!</p>

            <h2>trying new foods</h2>
            <p>As a child, I was an incredibly picky eater. It was much easier to list the foods that I liked, then listing all of the foods I refused to eat. So, it is quite shocking for me to say now, I absolutely love trying new foods. The picture above is actually my first time having a hamburger! </p>

            <h2>sports</h2>
            <p>Not sure why I listed this last because this probably consumes my free time the most; whether it is playing, coaching, going to a sporting event, or watching a game on TV. My personal experience with sports started with playing volleyball and now I have been coaching high school volleyball for the past 5 years. Also, probably one of my favorite parts of living in KC (and why I may never leave) has been having season tickets to the Kansas City Chiefs for 5 years. The picture above is actually from the night the Chiefs won the SuperBowl!</p>
